# Grind Knight's DM Handbook

Welcome to the Grind Knight's DM Handbook, a resource dedicated to helping developers learn and understand the Dream Maker (DM) language used primarily within the BYOND platform. This repository hosts a BYOND project featuring a series of .dm files, each dedicated to explaining a specific proc, game programming pattern, or illustrating common code examples.

## Structure

The project is divided into two main directories: `DM Examples` and `Game Programming Patterns`. Each directory contains .dm files that delve into and demonstrate their respective topics.

- `DM Examples` explores built-in functionalities DM provides and showcases use case examples.
- `Game Programming Patterns` covers common patterns found in video game development (such as the logic behind an inventory system) and gives working examples.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Grind_Knights_DM_Handbook/Grind Knight's DM Handbook.dme` file with the BYOND environment.
3. Compile the project.
4. Run the project to launch the game. In the "Demo" category, you'll find a list of verbs. Each verb corresponds to a proc, pattern, or example demonstrated in this project.
5. To learn about a specific topic, use the corresponding verb in the game to see it in action.
6. For additional details on what a specific proc, pattern, or example does, refer to its corresponding .dm file in this project.

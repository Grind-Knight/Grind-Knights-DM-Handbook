# Grind Knight's DM Handbook

Welcome to Grind Knight's DM Handbook, a resource dedicated to helping developers learn and understand the Dream Maker (DM) language, primarily used in the BYOND platform. This repository houses a BYOND project with a collection of .dm files, each dedicated to explaining a specific proc, game programming pattern, or common code examples.

## Structure

The project is divided into three main directories: `Procs`, `Code_examples`, and `Game_programming_patterns`. Each directory contains .dm files that explain and showcase their respective topics.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `Grind_Knights_DM_Handbook/Grind Knight's DM Handbook.dme` file with the BYOND environment.
3. Compile the project.
4. Run the project to launch the game. You will see a list of verbs in the "Demo" category. Each verb corresponds to a proc, pattern, or example in this project.
5. To learn about a specific topic, find the corresponding verb and use it in the game to see it in action.
6. For more information about what the proc, pattern, or example does, find its corresponding .dm file in this project.
